I chose to write about the psychological impact of branding through fonts and colour. I chose to do this as I have always had an interest in how the human mind works, and how companies can use that through subliminal messaging. Throughout my publication I am focusing on the way typography can influence peoples psychology, the main case study for this is through marketing and company branding. This is why my main influence for my blogs was various consumer items, such as beer and fast food restaurants. Colour theory is a big tool used by designers to impact peoples psychology. This shows how typography can influence consumers behaviour.
