For years designers have had many tools to provoke the mind of viewers. One of these tools being fonts. However the use of fonts, branding and logos to create emotional responses has only been fully realised in the past few decades. These uses of fonts are often used to create brand identities. A good example of this is the Top Gear magazine, DixonBaxi developed the typeface known as TG industry. This gives the brand a consistent presence across all its media platforms.Â

So what is the psychology of fonts? Essentially humans love to apply human characteristics to objects, and non human entities, this is known as anthropomorphism. Due to humans' emotional response to visuals, designers can manipulate these psychological responses the viewers have, this is done through the use of fonts and colour. Due to humans having higher engagement with visual content than written content, this is referred to as picture superiority effect by psychologists. This means the font and visuals on a brand's logos are more memorable than the written content.

In order to make an audience respond to a brand the designer can not only change the text appearance but also the font design, various fonts can be used for emotional effect or a more powerful effect. A good example would be if a business wants to come across as stable and formal, they could use a traditional serif font, while a company who wants to appear innovative and forward thinking can use a more futuristic sans font.

However a more psychological approach can be taken, with the combination of various emotional impacts. This includes the change of colour or size, or even outline. These techniques can be used to display multiple moods.
