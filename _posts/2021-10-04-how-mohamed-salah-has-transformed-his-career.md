**For years designers have had many tools to provoke the mind of viewers. One of these tools being fonts. However the use of fonts, branding and logos to create emotional responses has only been fully realised in the past few decades. These uses of fonts are often used to create brand identities. A good example of this is the Top Gear magazine, DixonBaxi developed the typeface known as TG industry. This gives the brand a consistent presence across all its media platforms.**Â

**So what is the psychology of fonts? Essentially humans love to apply human characteristics to objects, and non human entities, this is known as anthropomorphism. Due to humans' emotional response to visuals, designers can manipulate these psychological responses the viewers have, this is done through the use of fonts and colour. Due to humans having higher engagement with visual content than written content, this is referred to as picture superiority effect by psychologists. This means the font and visuals on a brand's logos are more memorable than the written content.**
